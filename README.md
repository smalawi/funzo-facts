Interested in expanding your trivia knowledge? No? Look no further than funzo-facts. The above
misinformation was generated by this program, which makes use of [a large corpus of Jeopardy! questions
and answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/)
(hence the question-answer format) and Markov chains via
[the Markovify library](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify).

## Usage

Locally:

```python
from funzo_fact_gen import FactGenerator

...

fg = FactGenerator()
print fg.get_fact()
```

See ```example_script.py``` for a sample (python 2.7).
